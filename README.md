Hand Fracture Detection Using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect hand fractures from medical imaging scans (X-ray or CT). The system classifies images into fractured and non-fractured categories, assisting radiologists and medical professionals in faster diagnosis.

Features
CNN-based binary classification of hand images
Pretrained models are being used 
Preprocessing and augmentation of medical images
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
Clear structure for training, validation, and testing

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled hand X-ray images divided into fractured and non-fractured classes.
Images are preprocessed to standard size and normalized for optimal model training.

Results
Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing fractured and non-fractured hand images
Confusion matrix and evaluation metrics included in the notebook

Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on your code)
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
